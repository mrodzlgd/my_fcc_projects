          Started to work as a teacher to finance her sister’s medical studies in Paris.</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - Moved to Paris to study at The Sorbonne to study physics, chemistry, and mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>1893</strong> - She obtained her Licentiateship in Physical Sciences.</li>
        <li><strong>1894</strong> - She obtained her Licentiateship in Mathematical Sciences. Met Pierre Curie who was
          completing a Doctorate of Science.</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong> - Marie married Pierre Curie.</li>
        <li><strong>1896</strong> - Henri Becquerel found a phenomenon where the element uranium gives off unusual rays of energy.
          After studying it, Marie named the phenomenon <strong>radioactivity</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>1897</strong> - Marie and Pierre had their first daughter, Irene.</li>
        <li><strong>1898</strong> - The Curies announced their discovery of two new elements, <strong>radium</strong> and <strong>polonium</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>1900</strong> - Marie was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure for girls in Sèvres
          where she introduced a method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations.</li>
        <li><strong>1903</strong>
          <ul>
            <li> Marie became the first woman in France to receive a doctoral degree.</li>
            <li> Marie and Pierre shared with Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery and research of radioactivity.</li>
            <li> Marie became the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>1904</strong> - Marie and Pierre had their second daughter, Eve.</li>

        <li><strong>1911</strong> - Marie is awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for the isolation of pure radium.</li>
        <li><strong> 1914</strong> - Marie oversaw the completion of the building of the laboratories of the Radium Institute at the University of Paris.
          When World War I began, Marie, with the help of her daughter Irene, devoted herself to making X-ray technology available for use
          in the medical treatment of wounded soldiers.</li>
        <li><strong> 1921</strong> - Accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a journey to the United States,
          where President Warren G. Harding presented her with a gram of radium bought as the result of a collection among
          American women.</li>
        <li><strong> 1922</strong> - Marie focused her research on the chemistry of radioactive substances and the
          medical applications of these substances.</li>
        <li><strong>1932 </strong> - Marie helped open the Radium Institute in Warsaw.</li>
        <li><strong> 1934</strong> - On July 4, Marie died near Sallanches, France. Her death was the result of leukemia caused by exposure
          to radiation.</li>
        <li><strong> 1944</strong> - American chemists discovered a new element. They named it curium in honor of Marie and Pierre Curie.</li>
